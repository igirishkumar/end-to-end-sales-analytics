# 📊 Sales Performance Analytics — Project Overview

This project presents an end‑to‑end Sales Analytics solution built using Power BI, Python, and a clean dimensional data model. It demonstrates the full lifecycle of a BI/Analytics project — from raw data ingestion and cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA), data modeling, and dashboard development.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a reliable and scalable **star schema** for sales analytics.
- Clean and validate raw sales data using Python.
- Perform a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** across fact and dimension tables.
- Develop an interactive **Power BI dashboard** for executive‑level insights.
- Present the project in a structured, professional GitHub repository.

## 🧱 Data Architecture

The project uses a **star schema** with one fact table and four dimension tables:

Date Dimension
│
Product Dim ─── Sales Fact ─── Customer Dim
│
Region Dimension
